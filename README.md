# Expenses chart component - Frontend Mentor solution

This is a solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

### Project Goals

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## Development Process

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While I initially thought I knew what 'mobile-first' development meant, I realized I was sorely mistaken on my last mobile responsive project and spent hours refactoring CSS. This time around, I've implemented a true mobile-first process that made working with the media queries far less time consuming.

Given this is my first React project, I've been learning a ton about React as I go, and have kept a specific eye out for any best practices I should be learning to develop good habits early. I also really like being able to have my CSS organized by component, and overall have put good effort into keeping a clean and organized file structure for the project.

Additionally, working with React also meant learning how to deploy my React App on Github Pages. While this process is probably mundane to most, I thought the idea of deploying the new build in my local repository, pushing it to the remote, and having the remote create a new branch with a static build deploy was super interesting.
